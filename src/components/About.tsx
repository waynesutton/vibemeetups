          Vibe Coding is a community of developers, designers, and tech enthusiasts who believe in
          creating beautiful, functional, and human-centered code. We host regular meetups where
          developers can share knowledge, collaborate on projects, and connect with like-minded
          individuals. Our mission is to foster a supportive environment where creativity meets
          technology, and where every line of code tells a story. Join us to experience coding in a
          whole new light.
